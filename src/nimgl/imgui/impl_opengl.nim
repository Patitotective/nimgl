## ImGUI OpenGL (modern OpenGL with shaders / programmatic pipeline) Implementation
## ====
## Implementation based on the imgui examples implementations.
## Feel free to use and modify this implementation.
## This needs to be used along with a Platform Binding (e.g. GLFW, SDL, Win32, custom..)
##
## HACK: To be honest, there are a lot of things to optimize in here if you have control of every step.
